        <h2>Office of Scientific Research and Development. September 30, 1944</h2>
        <div class="quote"><p>“In response your suggestion we outline in the two attached memoranda our thoughts on the international post-war aspects of the special project. We believe that the following points are correct, and of great importance to the future peace of the world.</p>
<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>1. By next summer this will become a matter of great military importance.
<br>2. The art will expand rapidly after the war, and the military aspects may become overwhelming.
<br>3. This country has a temporary advantage which may disappear, or even reverse, if there is a secret arms race on this subject...”</p>
<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>“Present Military Potentialities. There is every reason to believe that before August 1, 1945, atomic bombs will have been demonstrated and that the type then in production would be the equivalent of 1,000 to 10,000 tons of high explosive in so far as general blast damage is concerned. This means that one B-29 bomber could accomplish with such a bomb the same damage against weak industrial and civilian targets as 100-1,000 B-29 bombers.”</p>
      </div>
      <p>In a memo to the Secretary of War, the Office of Scientific Research and Development outlined the consequences of the Manhattan Project. The authors, Vannevar Bush and James Conant, describe the possible military implications of developing and using an atomic bomb during World War II. The authors state that nuclear weaponry will be a matter of “great importance” by 1945 and that it will be of greater military importance within the near future. The authors recognize that the development of nuclear arms will result in international arms proliferation; however the US has a significant nuclear advantage over other countries in 1944.<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>The memo also states that the bomb would have the potential to produce a blast equivalent to the blast produced by one thousand B-29 Fortresses. By using the atomic bomb, the US would be able to minimize risk and reduce air force casualties.</p>

        <h2>By the Numbers: World-Wide Deaths</h2>
        <div class="quote" style="text-align:center"><p><u>Military Deaths by Country.</u><br>Japan: 2,120,000<br><u>World Wide Casualties</u><br>Battle Deaths: 15,000,000</p></div>
        <p>The table shows that there were over 2.1 million Japanese military deaths. Japanese military deaths account for almost fifteen percent of all battle deaths in WWII. Japanese soldiers demonstrated their resolve, undeterred by death or defeat. Had the US not dropped the atomic bombs, the Japanese would have continued their conquest, leading to countless more deaths.</p>

        <p>By 1944, the US was making progress in its Pacific island hopping campaign. As the US forces gained control of Sipan Island, Japanese civilians threw themselves off of the island’s steep cliffs; approximately one thousand Japanese civilians died in the mass suicides. The Japanese would have rather died than surrender to US troops. Had the US refrained from dropping the atomic bombs and bringing a swift end to the war, the Allies’ campaign through the Pacific would have dragged on for several years, endangering the lives of countless more American and Japanese citizens.

        <h2>Major General L.R. Groves. April 23, 1945.</h2>
        <div class="quote"><p>“The successful development of the Atomic Fission Bomb will provide the United States with a weapon of tremendous power which should be a decisive factor in winning the present war more quickly with a saving in American lives and treasure. If the Unite States continues to lead in the development of atomic energy weapons, its future will be much safer and the chances of preserving world peace greatly increased.<br>Each bomb is estimated to have the equivalent effect of from 5,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT now, and ultimately, possibly as much as 100,000 tons.”</p>
<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>“Foreign Activities...
Russia. The russian Government since early 1943 has evinced a strong interest in our activities and through its diplomatic, information and espionage groups in the United States has made efforts to secure particularized information concerning the project. These activities have been carefully watched by...the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”</p>
<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>“Germany. Germany has a number of scientists prominent in the atomic field...There would no longer appear to be any possibility that Germany could use an atomic bomb in this war.</p>
<div id="smallbreak"></div><p>Japan. As far as is known, there is no prospect that Japan could develop an atomic bomb for use in the present war.”</p>
    </div>
        <p>The document, a memo to President Truman from General Leslie Groves, outlines the significance of the Manhattan Project. Groves states that the atomic bomb would produce a blast unparalleled by traditional precision bombing tactics. General Groves, an engineer and the director of the Manhattan Project, predicted that the bomb would bring a swift end to the war.</p><div id="smallbreak"></div>
        <p>The memo also describes the development of nuclear bombs in other countries involved in WWII. Groves stated that the government had been monitoring Russian spies and was careful to maintain the secrecy of the Manhattan Project. At the time, the US and UK were the only countries close to producing a functional atomic weapon. By the time it developed its own nuclear weapon, the US would have a significant advantage over the rest of the world, establishing it as a superior international military power.</p>

        <h2>Secretary of War Stimson. May 14th, 1945.</h2>
        <div class="quote"><p>“...My own opinion at the time was that the time now and the method now to deal with Russia was to keep our mouths shut and let our actions speak for words. The Russians will understand them better than anything else. It is a case where we have got to regain the lead and perhaps do it in a pretty rough and realistic way. They have rather taken it away from us because we have talked too much and have been too lavish with our beneficences to them. I told him this was a place where we really held all the cards. I called it a royal straight flush and we mustn’t be a fool about the way we play it....let our actions speak for themselves.”</p></div>
        <p> In a diary entry, Secretary of War Henry Stimson discusses the political advantages involved in dropping the atomic bomb. Stimson discusses how he thinks the US should deal with Russia in such a critical time of the war. Stimson states that the US should demonstrate its abilities through actions rather than words. After conquering Berlin and forcing Germany’s ultimate surrender in early May, Russia had taken the lead from the US; Stimson believed that the US could “regain the lead...in a pretty rough and realistic way” by dropping the bomb and ending the war in the Pacific. <div class="smallbreak"></div><p>Stimson describes the US’s position with a poker metaphor, comparing the US’s unique military advantage to a “royal straight flush” that must be played in a very strategic, calculated way. Stimson also believed that the detonation of the atomic bomb would be an appropriate show of force to intimidate Russia. </p>

        <h2>Thadore Van Kirk</h2>
        <p>In an interview, Theodore Van Kirk, the last surviving crew member of the nuclear bomb mission, expressed his opinion on the US’s use of the nuclear bombs in WWII. Kirk stated that the use of the atomic bomb was necessary to end the war, and that it saved countless American and Japanese lives by preventing a full scale invasion. Kirk stated: “[Japanese] people suffered an awful lot...dropping the atomic bomb saved their lives and our lives. If we had had to invade Japan, the casualties would have been much...higher, and our casualties would have been terrific.” Kirk also noted that in 2010, the US government was distributing Purple Hearts made during WWII in preparation for an invasion of Japan; Kirk says that “we still haven’t used all the Purple Hearts manufactured at that time”</p>

        <h2>Marshal Georgii Konstantinovich Zhukov. 1971.</h2>
        <div class = "quote"><p>“I do not recall the exact date, but after the close of one of the formal meetings Truman informed Stalin that the United States now possessed a bomb of exceptional power, without, however, naming it the atomic bomb.
As was later written abroad, at that moment Churchill fixed his gaze on Stalin’s face, closely observing his reaction. However, Stalin did not betray his feelings and pretended that he saw nothing special in what Truman had imparted to him. Both Churchill and many other Anglo-American authors subsequently assumed that Stalin had really failed to fathom the significance of what he had heard.
In actual fact, on returning to his quarters after this meeting Stalin, in my presence, told Molotov about his conversation with Truman. The latter reacted almost immediately. ‘Let them. We’ll have to talk it over with Kurchatov and get him to speed things up.’
I realized that they were talking about research on the atomic bomb.
It was clear already then that the US Government intended to use the atomic weapon for the purpose of achieving its Imperialist goals from a position of strength in “the cold war.” This was amply corroborated on August 6 and 8. Without any military need whatsoever, the Americans dropped two atomic bombs on the peaceful and densely-populated Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.”</p>
</div>
        <p>In his account of the Potsdam Conference where Truman told Stalin of the US’s nuclear capabilities, Marshal Zhukov, a prominent Soviet leader, states that he believed the US’s detonation of the atomic bombs was a display of power in preparation for the Cold War. Unlike the accounts of other leaders who witnessed the exchange, Zhukov states that Stalin understood the significance of Truman’s words. Immediately after hearing of the news, Stalin ordered the acceleration of the Soviet nuclear development program. Zhukov believed the use of the atomic bomb was intended to intimidate the Soviets while “achieving its Imperialist goals from a position of strength.” </p>
