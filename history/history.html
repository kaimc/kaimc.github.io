      <h2>Japan</h2>
      <p>Hideki Tojo is the nations military leader and Hirohito is the Emperor. The Meji period in the late 19th century brought industrialization, centralisation, militarization, and “westernization” to Japan. Japan becomes an Imperial superpower and prepares to conquer other nations. This leads to the invasion of Manchuria, starting the Japanese-Ruso War and their connquest to take over the East. On December 7, 1941, Japan carries out a suprise attack on Pearl Harbor that resulted in the death of apporximately 3,000 American sailors, ultimately spinning the United States into war. The United States "island hopped" throughout the Pacific, taking each Japanese island in their advance towards Japan.info</p>

      <h2>Japanese War Culture</h2>
      <p>“...Japanese fighting men did not surrender, even in the face of insuperable odds.” -General Robert Brooke-Popham

“Do not live in shame as a prisoner. Die, and leave no ignominious crime behind you.” -General Hideki Tojo

Japan had a strong sense of dying with honor. Their culture makes it difficult for them to recognize surrender. This posed as an obstacle to America which lead to Truman's consideration of the atomic bomb.</p>

      <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
      <p>Scientist around the globe, escaping Nazi persecution and facism, such as Albert Einstein, fled to the United States. With the news that German physicists knew how to develop a uranium bomb, the United States government started the Manhattan project. The goal of the project was to assemble a team of America’s top scientists and to design and build an effective atomic bomb. The main assembly plant was built in Los Alamos, New Mexico. With the successful test of a nuclear bomb at the “Trinity Site”, the world entered the Nuclear Age.</p>

Three days later on 8 August 1945, 40,000 people died on the dropping of the second bomb on Nagasaki. 100,000 more people died the months following the bomb dropping due to radiation poisoning. U.S. President Truman used an executive order to drop the bomb. It is so far the only nuclear attack in history.</p>
