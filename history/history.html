      <h2>Japan</h2>
      <p>Hideki Tojo is the nations military leader and Hirohito is the Emperor. The Meji period in the late 19th century brought industrialization, centralisation, militarization, and “westernization” to Japan. Japan becomes an Imperial superpower and prepares to conquer other nations. This leads to the invasion of Manchuria, starting the Japanese-Ruso War and their connquest to take over the East. On December 7, 1941, Japan carries out a suprise attack on Pearl Harbor that resulted in the death of apporximately 3,000 American sailors, ultimately spinning the United States into war. The United States "island hopped" throughout the Pacific, taking each Japanese island in their advance towards Japan.info</p>

    <div id="Japanese War Culture">
      <h2>Japanese War Culture</h2>
      <p>“...Japanese fighting men did not surrender, even in the face of insuperable odds.” -General Robert Brooke-Popham

“Do not live in shame as a prisoner. Die, and leave no ignominious crime behind you.” -General Hideki Tojo

Japan had a strong sense of dying with honor. Their culture makes it difficult for them to recognize surrender. This posed as an obstacle to America which lead to Truman's consideration of the atomic bomb.</p>

    <div id="Soviet Union">
      <h2>Soviet Union</h2>
      <p>The Non-Aggression Pact in 1939 was a Soviet Union and Nazi Germany agree on peace arrangement for 10 years. Stalin viewed the pact as a way to stay on peaceful terms with Germany as they mobilized their armies The pact contained secret agreements on how they would divide Eastern Europe after WWII. It falls apart in 1941 when Nazis invade Soviet Union. On April 25, 1945, the Soviet Union takes control of Berlin. Being seen as a threat to America, Stalin became a reason to drop the atomic bomb on Japan as a "show of force".</p>

      <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
      <p>Scientist around the globe, escaping Nazi persecution and facism, such as Albert Einstein, fled to the United States. With the news that German physicists knew how to develop a uranium bomb, the United States government started the Manhattan project. The goal of the project was to assemble a team of America’s top scientists and to design and build an effective atomic bomb. The main assembly plant was built in Los Alamos, New Mexico. With the successful test of a nuclear bomb at the “Trinity Site”, the world entered the Nuclear Age.</p>
